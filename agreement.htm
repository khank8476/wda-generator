        Provider agrees to use best efforts to hold Confidential Information
        in the strictest confidence, not to make use of it other than for the
        performance of its obligations hereunder, to release it only to the

        as expressly binding the employee not to use or disclose the
        Confidential Information, except as expressly permitted herein. The
        Client shall be listed as a third-Party beneficiary of any such
        agreement. Service Provider will notify the Client in writing of any
        circumstances within its knowledge relating to any unauthorized
        possession, use, or knowledge of such Confidential Information.

        pursuing the development of the Website is to gain a significant
        competitive advantage over competitors operating without such Website

        Service Provider acknowledges that the Client's Confidential
        Information is a valuable, special and unique asset of the Client's
        business and as such the following covenants protect a legitimate
        interest and do not solely serve to limit the Service provider's
        future competition. Accordingly, Service Provider agrees to keep such
        negotiations and performance of its obligations hereunder strictly
        confidential and not to disclose any information to any third Party or
        entity without the prior written permission of the Client.

        Information, except the limited right to use such Confidential
        Information in connection with the Services to be provided under this
        Agreement. The Client or Service Provider shall not receive any
        intellectual property rights in the Confidential Information of the

        codes, documentation, flowcharts, algorithms, marketing plans,

        Provider's part, or
        (II) is disclosed to third Parties by the Client without restriction

        Confidential Information.

        sole property of Client. The service provider agrees that disclosure
        of such information to, or use by, third Parties, either during or
        after this Agreement, will cause Client, irreparable damage. Service
        Provider agrees to use best efforts to hold Confidential Information
        in the strictest confidence, not to make use of it other than for the
        performance of its obligations hereunder, to release it only to the

        employee not to use or disclose the Confidential Information, except
        as expressly binding the employee not to use or disclose the
        Confidential Information, except as expressly permitted herein. The
        Client shall be listed as a third-Party beneficiary of any such
        agreement. Service Provider will notify the Client in writing of any
        circumstances within its knowledge relating to any unauthorized
        possession, use, or knowledge of such Confidential Information.

        pursuing the development of the Website is to gain a significant
        competitive advantage over competitors operating without such Website

        Client's negotiations with the Service Provider or the performance by
        the Service Provider of its obligations hereunder. Additionally, the
        Service Provider acknowledges that the Client's Confidential
        Information is a valuable, special and unique asset of the Client's
        business and as such the following covenants protect a legitimate
        interest and do not solely serve to limit the Service provider's
        future competition. Accordingly, Service Provider agrees to keep such
        negotiations and performance of its obligations hereunder strictly
        confidential and not to disclose any information to any third Party or
        entity without the prior written permission of the Client.

        Information, except the limited right to use such Confidential
        Information in connection with the Services to be provided under this
        Agreement. The Client or Service Provider shall not receive any
        intellectual property rights in the Confidential Information of the
        other Party other than a limited right to use the Confidential
        Information for the purposes specified in this Agreement. All
        intellectual property rights shall continue to vest with the Party
        disclosing the Confidential Information.

        riots, pandemic, civil disorders, rebellions or revolutions, or any
        other similar cause beyond the reasonable control of such Party (each,
        a "Force Majeure Event"), and such non-performance, hindrance or delay
        could not have been prevented by reasonable precautions, then the

        non-performance, hindrance or delay, as applicable, of those
        obligations effected by the Force Majeure Event for as long as such
        Force Majeure Event continues and such Party continues to use its best
        efforts to recommence performance whenever and to whatever extent
        possible without delay, including through the use of alternate
        sources, workaround plans or other means. The Party whose performance
        is prevented, hindered, or delayed by a Force Majeure Event will

        Majeure Event and describe in reasonable detail the nature of the
        Force Majeure Event.

        exceeding 30 (thirty) business days, the Parties shall mutually agree
